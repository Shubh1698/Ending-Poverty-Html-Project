        <p style="font-size:25px">Together we can be
the generation that ends poverty, forever. Every child will go to school, every child will
have protection from violence and we will eradicate
absolute poverty.We must do everything in our power to
achieve them, but also find an agreed way forward
on work that will remain to be accomplished.</p>
			<br>
      <P style="font-size:25px">
        Sustainable development is a priority goal for the global community that joined forces to eliminate poverty.
         Poverty is the inability to participate in normal civil life, due to lack of necessary financial resources.Children born in poverty lack everything. Sometimes poverty continues throughout their whole life. Poverty in early childhood might cause mental and physical impairments. In 2011-2013, 4% of the population and 6% of children lived in absolute poverty. Relative poverty is higher in children, and is increasing at higher rate.  The
MDG fraction-target approach has encouraged many
countries to focus on those who are easiest to reach,
with the result that people closest to coming out of
poverty have sometimes benefited disproportionately
from improved access to such services, and the gap
between this group and the very poorest people
has inadvertently been widened – at the same time
as the gap between the richest group in society and
the poorest has also been yawning ever wider.
      </P>
      <br>
      <p style="font-size:25px">
        These challenges can be tackled, and should be
integrated across all the goals in the new framework.
There are also important principles governing the
choice of goals themselves. The next development
framework must retain a clear and unambiguous
focus on poverty reduction, speeding up action to
improve the quality of life of the world’s poorest and
most marginalised people.
      </p><br>
      <p style="font-size:25px">
        Save the Children believes
goals on poverty, hunger, health, education, protection
from violence and governance will be paramount,
supported by goals which foster a supportive and
sustainable environment for human development.
They are common goals for all countries, but
the specific issues within these common goals
apply differently to countries at different stages
of development – so we propose common but
differentiated responsibility for the realisation of the
goals, in which each country decides how best to
achieve them.
