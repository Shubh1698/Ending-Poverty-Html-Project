          We provide free food for all the children as well as adults who  are in  need.
          We made the world’s biggest promise to its poorest people that we would tackle absolute poverty, child mortality, hunger – and that promise is
          only partially fulfilled. We need to renew and extend the promise. For the first time in human history.</p></center>

          so we have pre-made food which is prepared by our staff on the spot as we dont want anyone to go without getting anything from our camps.
           Our staff is alaways there to deliver and perfom tasks that needs attention.</p></center>

                The effects of poverty on children are wide-reaching and can lead to lifelong struggles, especially when young people don’t receive full educations.
          Poverty and education are inextricably linked, because people living in poverty may stop going to school so they can work, which leaves them without literacy and numeracy skills they need to further their careers.
           Their children, in turn, are in a similar situation years later, with little income and few options but to leave school and work.</p></center>
